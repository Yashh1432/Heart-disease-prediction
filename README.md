❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System (PHP + ML)
📋 Project Overview

The Heart Disease Prediction System is a web-based application that uses Machine Learning integrated with a PHP frontend to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on user-input medical data. This system helps users assess risk factors and encourages early diagnosis.
🚀 Features

    User-friendly form to input medical parameters

    Prediction of heart disease risk using trained ML model

    Visual feedback and recommendation

    Admin panel to view and manage predictions

    History of predictions per user (optional)

🧠 Machine Learning Model

    Built using Python and scikit-learn

    Model trained on the UCI Heart Disease Dataset

    Logistic Regression / Random Forest / SVM (based on implementation)

    Model exported using joblib or pickle

🛠️ Technologies Used

    Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap

    Backend: PHP

    ML Integration: Python script triggered from PHP (via exec() or API)
